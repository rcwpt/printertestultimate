📋 Overview

Most printer test pages are ugly, low-resolution images, or require downloading PDF files. This project is a pure HTML/CSS solution that renders vector-sharp geometry and text directly to the printer spooler.

It features a custom print stylesheet (@media print) that removes the UI and formats the output perfectly for A4 paper.

✨ Features

The tool consists of 4 specialized diagnostic pages:

1. Color & Ink Density

CMYK & RGB Blocks: 100% saturation tests to check for clogged nozzles.

Nozzle Check Pattern: Fine repeating lines to detect print head misalignment.

2. Precision Geometry

Millimeter Grid: A full-page 1mm alignment grid.

Registration Marks: Checks if the paper feed is straight or skewed.

Center Crosshair: For verifying print centering.

3. Typography & Legibility

Font Scaling: Tests text sharpness from 6pt (Micro) up to 72pt.

Monospace Render: "Hacker/Terminal" style font to check character spacing.

Inverse Contrast: White text on black background to test ink bleeding.

4. Graphics & Dithering

Gradients: Smooth transitions to check for banding issues.

Radial Burst: High-frequency lines to test print resolution and aliasing.
